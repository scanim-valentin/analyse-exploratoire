The main topic of our project is feature recognition applied to a dataset of our choice. Feature recognition is the process of identifying relevant characteristics - called features - from an image. This topic plays a major role in the field of computer vision, and has a wide range of applications, including object recognition, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. 

We have chosen to make a web application aiming to match the user with the celebrity they most resembles from a set of celebrity face images - the dataset.  The dataset is called CelebA and is composed of two elements. The first element is a folder containing 200,000 celebrity face images. The second element is a spreadsheet with each column representing a relevant facial feature (e.g. “Glasses”, “Green Eyes”, “Long Hair”) and each row representing a celebrity image in the folder. For each image, the spreadsheet indicates which facial feature - called attributes - the celebrity face image has.  

In this review, we firstly describe and explain our choice of architecture for our project. Then, we review each component of our application and our plans regarding their implementation. Finally, we conclude and set up our goals for future steps.
